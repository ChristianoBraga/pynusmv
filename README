PyNuSMV is a Python binding for NuSMV. It is intended to provide a Python interface to NuSMV, allowing to use NuSMV as a library.


-----
BUILD
-----

To build PyNuSMV, you have to compile NuSMV first:

# Compile CUDD
cd src/cudd-2.4.1.1
make # use platform-dependent makefile if needed

# Compile NuSMV
cd ../nusmv
./configure
make
cd ..

Then, you can build PyNuSMV by running:
./build_libnusmv.sh
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

PyNuSMV is located into src/pynusmv directory.
